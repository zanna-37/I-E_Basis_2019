# Trust the Machines! ðŸ¤–

- Human progress depends on trusting the machine
- Infinite queues and lazy employees - delays in day-to-day life, humans fail and have consequences to others
- Humans are fallible and they can say no if they don't feel comfortable - machines won't say no to perform a risky surgery
- Online banks - no queues, 24/7 availability, decisions based on numbers - not on emotions, better management of money, no greed
- Machines are efficient, availavble 24/7, scalable to everywhere
- They make decisions based on numbers, not on emotions. This means:
  - Equal treatement
  - Objectivity
- Machines always know the best solution for the global prospective
- Machine can quickly find mistakes and prevent crisis and deflation in an economic system
- Making error is part of humans existence
- Experience is based on errors and they may be costfull
- Machines learn without the need of trivial mistakes (they are already been made by others and they just learn from them)
- More time (for humans) to focus on what matters

## Medicine

- Machines don't fell the pressure and emotions that can decrease performance
- Surgeries can take less time
- Better analysis and diagnosis
- Machines can not only provide a diagnosis but also predictions

## Driving

- Machines will be better and more efficient at driving
- An automated driving system means less accidents thanks to coordination and precise calculation
  - No distractions
  - No alcohol
- Less fuel because of smothness of driving
- Punctuality, it is possible to have better planning
- Coordination
  - communication between machines to handle complex problems

## First Steps

- Humans can handle the shift into this vision because we are already moving toward it
- Humans can do research and focus on things that matters as spend more time with the family
- It's true that machines can make mistakes but they do it only once, humans make the same mistake over and over again

# Go Humans! ðŸ’ª

- Trust humans in a world dominated by machines
- Machines are better on specific tasks but it's better to trust humans for broader jobs

## Medicine

- In the medical field, humans can have a better understanding of the patient:
  - they can understand feelings and emotions
  - comfort the patient
  - machine can only _fake_ emotion and not provide real comfort
- Machines won't be able to do psychiatry because we need a deep emotional connection with the patient in order to succeed

### Empathy

- Empaty is a human thing and it's about understanding the human in front of you
- Empaty is important in medicine, as it can change the result of a treatement
- It includes delicacy on saying difficult news, the patient may react badly and machines won't have that sensibility

## Innovation

- Innovation is a matter of creativity and creativity cannot be modeled by machines
- Humans can think outside of the box, machines can't
  - these cannot be made by machines
  - humans can think outside the box

## Ethics

* For example, doctors take the hypocratical oath
* Algorithms may be biased, for instance, by the training sample

## Accountability

* Machines are black-boxes, what happens when an error occurs? Who responds for that? We cannot understand the reasoning that led to a given problem.

## Security & Privacy

- Machines are curious about data, this may mean that confidentiality will be broken
- Machine can be hacked, humans can't

Humans can deal with unseen scenarions and find answers to them. If a scenario is strange enough, the machine won't be able to create a solution because it ahs not data to base its decision on. The human is the real player in the world that we need to invest in. Machines are nothing more than a tool that we can use.
