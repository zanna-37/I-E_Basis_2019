# Overview [ðŸ“¹0:00](https://youtu.be/TDck7QKtaVY)

We are at some time in the future. The earth has colonized two planets and they have been developed and terraformed in two ways. One into a giant smart city and the other to a whole smart countryside.
The underling reasoning is to explore a centralized city solution versius a decentralized countryside one.

You have a ticket from planet Earth to go to one of these planets, which one will you choose?

# Smart Countrysides - because decentralized is better [ðŸ“¹2:36](https://youtu.be/TDck7QKtaVY?t=156)

- Countryside population is decreasing. This started in the industrial era. This shift from countryside to cities happened because cities offered comfort and features that countryside couldn't
- The proposal is a different countryside, enhanced with technology and will all the perks of the countryside
- In cities characteristic things and traditions slowly vanish
- We already mostly live in cities, the real **innovation is to try something new** and not a enhanced copy of Earth
- Bring all the services and comforts of the city to the countryside
- Transportation
  It is crucial to have fast transportation to shorten the barrier of living far away to each other
  Possible solutiosn include:
  - fast air transportation with drones for people
  - autonomous drones for goods
- For food supply, every farmer can sell directly and it is responsible for the quality
- Decentralised transportation leads to a better and more valuable exchange of goods
- Coworking space shared even among different companies to share ideas and innovate
- Education syllabus includes 2 types of schools:
  - Physical schools
  - Virtualised platforms - advanced technologies such as hologram
    - Virtualize meeting for work and education to be more efficient and avoid the costs of commuting
- Robots are making part of our life. Robots will provide safety, for example, robots for city surveillance and police activities
  - Robotech: a personal digital assistant
- Societal drivers - we have a passion and a mission that we want to achieve, being part of a community we strive to follow a common goal
- There are more nature and more space for animals and backyards
- Understimulation is not a problem, as people vision will change
- Decentralised is better, it is the future, don't be afraid to change it
- You don't have to plan nature [as in cities, ed.], it's already there

# Smart Cities [ðŸ“¹11:02](https://youtu.be/TDck7QKtaVY?t=662)

- Today cities have problems for example air pollution, overcrowdedness and many others
- In today cities, the ground area has always remained the same since 100/200 years ago; they were not designed for a large population and it is the source of the problems listed previously. Engineering the city with large population in mind will give the possibility to avoid most of the problems
- The proposal is tho have the planet structured as a massive global smart city fully design from scratch
- Centralized approach
- Transportation
  The city is developed in layers
  - Short distance happen in a ecological fashion on the ground level, walking, cycling and general physical activity in encouradged
  - Underground public transportation differenciated between goods and people
  - Cars are not needed and we can get rid of them
    - no jams
    - no parking lots
    - no more accidents
  - Everything is electric powered, so no pollution
- Culture and education
  - Every kind of institute is available and it is affortable for everyone
  - There are a lot of organized workshops and cultural events outside schools
  - It is important to preserve cultural diversities
  - With a centralised approach we can avoid illiteracy
- With many people around in the same place it is possible to live in a multicultural envirounment
- Meeting people is easier
- Having central hospitals, allow to always have the best doctors and researches
- Centralised workplace where all firms are, it is easy to choose which firm to work in
- Food on demand, shipped in minutes to your home through pipes
- In a city, there is positive natural contamination of culture and ideas
- The problem of too much stress, over-stimulation and fast-moving is something related to modern cities but not related to these new smart cities. They will address this through city plan and activities
- Countrysides are usually associated with relaxing and chilling, so countrysides will face understimulation
- Logistics can become an overhead in countrysides
- Cities have services that are always available, reliable and efficient
