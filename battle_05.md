[TOC]

We are in a distant future in which each people can decide whether to be cyborgs or genetic augmented. They are generic enough to be widely used at a reasonable price for the developed world.

# Cyborgs

* The human endeavour is to explore the world, gather knowledge and to be creative. This is what differentiate us from animals and from machines. Our bodies are **vulnerable**, we have **stress**, **fatigue** and we **age**. The fact that we don't have optimal physical and mental conditions means that our quality of life diminishes and that we can't live our life to the fullest. Our mind is free and we should empower it without any biological constraints.
* **Cytech** - organisation that creates and overviews creation of policies related to cyborg augmentations.
* We address concerns such as security, reliability, energy, installation, appearance, functionality.
  * **Security** - it works offline
  * **Reliability** - resistant
  *  **Energy** - there is one battery for everything
  * **Installation** - non-invasive and customised
  * **Appearance** - we want to be sure that everyone access cyber augmentations that resemble the human as much as possible
  * **Functionality** - enhance productivity, a healthy lifestyle and entertainment. Augmentations in offensive perspective are not allowed or tolerated.

## Health sector

The health sector is the top priority of the health sector, we want to eliminate disability. We have 3 main parts:

* Smart artifical prosthetics
* Bio-nanotechnology and biomaterials
* Brain controlled robotics

With cyborg parts we can eliminate disabilities, people can recover from incidents, we can monitor the body health with nanocells and we can have brain-controlled robotics.

We work with the government to get cytech into medical insurance so that everyone can use it. Customisation is also a premium offer for cosmetics.

## Mobility

Machines are much more capable than a biological body. We will be able to fly, jump higher and run faster. The body augmentation is not only sending signals to body parts but also receiving it. You might change your lungs to climb the mount everest, or have a mermaid tail.

## Communication

We provide next level security. You may have an implemented internet module in your brain so that you are always connected. The organs are offline so they can't be hacked. You can convey all of your ideas and thoughts with accuracy.

* Our natural sensors are limited but machine-made sensors are n

## Work

Improved productivity by increasing our cognitive and physical performance. There's not a problem of machines replacing men jobs because they live in harmony.

## Ethics and Society

By not changing the DNA, we are keeping the identity of humans and people.

You should go cyborg so that you can break the limits, make use the power of technology by using full power of ICT and mimic natural organs, we can easily scale up, we create an identity and keep ourselves

# Genetic modification

Imagine if you could not only change your strength but also your human relationships by being able to having an increased empathy.

Industries will still use robots to repetitive tasks but as humans we will have more time to dedicate to creativity and innovation. We will also reduce workplace hazards. We can increase skills/performance/productivity.

## Health sector

In the medical area we will be able to cure every disease, treat infertile framilies, trans people and another example we will be able to erradicate antibiotic resistant bacteria. We can create artificial organs with your own cells. The therapygenetics studies the impact of genes in mental diseases.

## Ethical boundaries

Regarding ethical boundaries, your modifications need to be justified, psychological requirements and consequences need to be informed and under 18 years old only for health purposes.

## Civil order

Regarding civil order, we will have trained and specialised security corps. We will have Specific Genetic Modifcations (GM) for rehabilitation such as have more empathy and facilitate inclusion in society.

## Population

Population you will be able to live longer and better. We can deal with exploitation of resources by decreasing the nutrients we need and optimise our digestive processes. Overpopulation can be address by limiting the maximum age of a human to 150~200 years

## Assets

You can be smarter, more strength and keep your human essence and we need to keep this by enforcing human relationships.
