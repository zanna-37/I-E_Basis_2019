Smart city vs smart countryside

# Battle 4 - Smart Cities vs Smart Countryside

## Overview

We are at some time in the future. The earth has colonised two planets and they have been developed and terraformed in two ways. One into a smart city and the other to a smart countryside, ideas of community scaled up to a planetary level.

You have a ticket from planet Earth to go to one of these planets, which one will you go?

## Smart Countryside

* Countryside population is decreasing. This started in the industrial era. This shift from countryside to cities happened because cities offered comfort and features that countryside couldn't.
* A different countryside, enhanced with technology and will all the perks of the countryside
* All the goodness of countryside can't be brough to cities
* Transportation is a resource, not a constraint. The transportation is so fast that is no longer a problem. We divided this into 2 levels:
  * Low level: logistics and food with drones
  * Upper level: drone cars to transport people

* The food goes directly from farms to table.
* Decentralised transportation leads to a better and more valuable exchange of goods
* Education syllabus includes 2 types of schools:
  * Physical schools
  * Virtualised platforms - advanced technologies such as hologram 
* Robots are making part of our life. Robots will provide safety, for example, robots for city surveillance and police activities.
* Happiness & social interaction - 
* Societal drivers - we have a passion and a mission that we want to achieve, being part of a community we strive to follow a common goal.
* Decentralised is better, it is the future, don't be afraid to change it. 

## Smart Cities

* Today's cities have problems such as:
  * pollution - sometimes we can't even see the horizon
  * overgrowing population
  * noide
  * neglection
  * chaotic life
* Urbanisation has been growing dramatically in all of the world
* The cause of this is the fact that cities are still growing in the same place
* Our planet is earth-like, it has a heterogeneous environment
* It is developed on human scale
* It is centralised!
* Transportation - there are no cars because they need parking lots, we have a good enough public transport system. Everything is fully electric
  * Shared mobility
  * Automation
  * Electrification
  * Smart technologies
* Education - every institute is available, there's no need to be rich and everyone has equal opportunities. We also provide conferences and activities such as workshops. With a centralised approach we can avoid iliteracy.
* This is also about cultural diversity:
  * Food
  * Social activities possible because there's many people around, sports

* Healthcare

  * # *Central* hospitals

  * Community clinicals

  * Robots housekeeps, IOT monitor system in all houses

* A day in the city

  * Food & groceries - get anything in minutes, different brands together, only fresh ingredients
  * Smart ingredient provider where you can get everything in minutes
  * Workplace - centralised workplace where all firms are, he can choose which firm to work in
  * His father is ill. Mark has a smart system that can remind his father to that medicine
  * Leisure time - go to a climb in the mountains
