# Battle 5 -

## Playing open cards

People vote multiple times throughout the debate and the question are targetized to keep balance between the groups.

## Overview

At some point you have to choose to be genetically augmneted or become a cyborg, or neither
people can affort this operation.. just some hundred of buck

## CYTECH - Dedicated to the future of human being

- Bonded to body constraint
  - Vulnereble
  - Aging
  - Fatigue
  - Stress
- No more biological contraint
- Empower mind with a new cyborg body
- Component designed to be resistant
  - Able to fully work offline
  - Battery to power everything
- Cybercels and programmable modules
- Cyberpart should resemble a real human body
- Enhance productivity
- Health is top priority
  - Eliminate disabilities, memomation
  - Possibility to recover from incidents
  - Monitoring body health with nanocells
  - Brain controlled robotics
- Mobility
  - augmnet the possibility to move, fly and go faster
  - get feelings from the robot parts
- Comunication and security
  - Direcly access the web through brain
  - all organs works are offline and inaccessible from the web, the controller is the brain
  - comunicate thoughts and sensation to other people
- Possibility to see not-visible light and a wider range of sound frequencies
- improved productivity
- Ethics and society
  - They don't change DNA and preserve the identity of the people
- Scalability
- Sports and olimpics should be changed but we should have different categories [for both teams]

# Human Enhancement

- Possibility to be smarter
- Better resistance to hazards
- increasy
- Treat every desease
- Infertile families
- Reimplantation or bioartificial organs
- Threrapygenetics â†’ treat mental health
- Ethical boundaries
  - You have to justify the change
  - Psicological requirements and information before having the surgery
  - 18+ year to receive a modification not related to health
- Enhanced security corps
- Genetic modification for rehabilitation
  - no GM dangerous for population
- live longer and better
- Overpopulation
  - decreasing the nutrients we need and optimize digestion process
- Overpopulation can be address by limiting the maximum age of a human to 150~200 years
- Sports and olimpics should be changed but we should have different categories [for both teams]
