# What is a battle?
## A case study based on debates!
What is a case study?
- Business ideas
- Analynzing competing solutions
  - Exploit the topic → pros and cons
  - Story to illustrate a concept

# Main key points for a battle
## Induction
- Achiving generalization starting from particular scenarios
  - `Ex:` _Telling general law starting from large number of examples_

### Problems of induction
- Wrong generalization
  - `Ex:` _Racism_
- Impossible to make a generalizion because of:
  - The past may not reflect the future
  - Too few data

## Deduction
I have a theory and I gather data to verify or contraddinct my theory

_Scintific method is falsificatory bacause it does not prove that some law is true. You're tring to find situations where the law does not apply_

### Problems of deduction
- The past may not reflect the future
- When people are sure about a thing they will continue to search for arguments that support they theory and not arguments against
  - `Cit:` _It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Inevitably, one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts._
    _\- Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)_
  - `Ex:` _The flat-earth theory_
  - `Ex:` _Conspiracy theories_

## British parliament
Key points:
- **Moderation**
- People **stand up** when they talk
- People are **not ashamed** to be expressive
- **Shout** if agree or not
- There is a **procedure** and a process
- Desingated **place** and **representatives**
- **Bold presence**
- **Summarize** their ideas
- **Sarcasm** and **theatrics**

# Why battles?
- To be able to build grounded opinions
- Real life gym/simulation

# Why is a battle related with entrepreneurship?
- Be prepared for questions not known in advance
- Be competitive
- Be persuasive

# Open / close debates
**Open:** there is no clear answer yet, there is still discussion. `Ex:` _Privacy, climate change, exploiting natural non-renewable resources, …_
**Close:** the time has already filter out an answer `Ex:` _Voting rights to women, is junk food good or not, …_

# Retrospective vs Prospecting
Debates can be retrospective or prospecting

## The Star Wars experiment
### Constructing a prequel:
The specker summarize the story from the IV to the VI and then he describe the I.
The test subject must guess what happens in the II and III

### Constructing a sequel:
The specker summarize the story now starting in the chronological order from the I to the IV.
The test subject must guess what happens in the last films (V and VI).

### Outcomes:
It is easier to construct a prequel than a sequel

## Retrospective
Main question is: **How did we get there?**
- Explaination (finding the answers)

## Prospecting
Main question is: **What happens next?**
- Create questions affecting final results

-----

# Conflict and competition
Cooperation → write the report together
Competition → fight against eachother

## Incremental innovation
Start-up is like creating a new restaurant
There is competition

## Disruptive
Iliad, Revolut and N26 were bold to enter bacause they had distruptive ideas
- Iliad for the price
- Banks bacause they are complitely online

# Who wins a battle
- The more persuasive

# Battle contents
## Horizontal
- The content used in the battle ca be shared and reused for other battles
  - `Ex:` _Human rights: how workers are treated_
  - `Ex:` _Ethics_

## Vertical
- Content are specific of a battle
  - `Ex:` _The model X is better than Y because of Z_

## Scenario
Building abstraction and wrapping through scenations
- By using scenarios we can project our discussion in a **new context** in order to **avoid bias**

# Battle activities
## Pre-Class
Meeting with teachers to discuss what is allowed and not allowed to bring to the battle

## In class
- **15 minutes to expose** your arguments
- Debate with people in the **class** that will **ask question**
- Conclusion: explain why my position **is still the right one** after the discussion

## Post class
