There's a need to talk about skills in an Innovation and Entrepreneurship course because it's very difficult to innovate or be entrepreneurial without skills. Some examples of skills are creative skills, time management, technical skills, agility, pitching, communication skills, awareness and sense of what's happening in the world. There's no simple bucket to put these skills, there are different broad ranges we can consider. Skills take all sorts of things and not a simple one.

Skills are needed for policy, academic and business worlds. They are not necessary in only one industry but essential for everyone in every field.

Every framework of skills varies and there is not a specific strucutre or universal truth about the importance, categorisation and organisation of skills.



**Definition**: Motivation is a driving force which affects the choice of alternatives in the behaviour of a person. It improves, stimulates and induces employees leading to goal-oriented behaviour.

Perserverance is the motivation applied in the long term in going forward with your idea and believing in it.

* Why is your skill relevant to I&E?

This skill is relevant because in order to be a good entrpeneur you have to be a good leader and to be a good leader you need to motivate those who you work with. You might fail a lot and having a strong mind and perserverance is necessary to go on. Fail fast, learn faster - even if we fail a lot of times we can use it to apply it and learn better ansd faster. **Motivation** is the reason for people's [actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(philosophy)), [willingness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volition_(psychology)) and [goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal).

* Where do you see it in action?

Without motivation there's not so much action. Motivation is the underlying feeling of all the actions you take. Perserverance: Business-y related, it's how you turn your ideas into a product or service. 

Motvation is the kick-start and the perserverance is what takes you far in the development of your idea.

* Who are the key actors using it?

The leader for himself and to motivate others; Motivation is mutual because even if you are a leader, your peers can be motivated to work and that helps with the carrying your idea forward. In a moment of weakness, having support from your peers/their motivation can increase your own motivation.

* How is it normally developed?

If you believe a lot in your idea and where you want the state of the world to be with it, it motivates you and gives you strength to carry it forward. Sharing a vision with your peers might increase their motivation - if they agree with your vision they will want to reach it as well. Being surrounded with the right people and attending the right activities can potentiate your motivation. Reaching targets can also be a source of motivation as you see your idea/product/service becoming realer (not a word) every day.

* How can it be developed in the "digital age"?

Listening to other people, TEDTalks. It's easier to connect with people with similar goals. It's easier to get inspired. In the digital age we have a lot of resources and a lot of things are constantly changing so it might be easy to change the world to fit your vision and to share it with the world than it was before. Facetiming people and not just calling/texting.

social media platforms can encourage employees and collaborators if they are publicly recognised for their work.

* When is the term applied spuriously?

When you're obsessed with an idea that is not feasible. You need to have an open-mind to give up on an idea if it's not worth it. When you don't accept critics. When you focus more on your personal goals than the value that your idea brings to society. Confusing motivation and perserverance with overworking. 

* How can it be applied to now vs the future?

Teach people to have their own independence. To learn how to fail and to give them problems so that they can solve them. When the big problems come, they have a framework for helping them to solve it.

## Conclusions

Skills are beyond entrepreneurship, it is not about creating a startup or operating a business, it is having an entrepreneurial mindset. Even if you want to be an employee, skills is what they are going to ask you about, this is what you need.

The second conclusion is the soft and hard barriers, if you want to have success and climb in your career you need to have a master degree but this ggets trickier, if you want to reach "quadro" or executive it is necessary to have skills, despite having a degree.

The trick here is to balance between the technical skills and then these soft barriers which if you can't overcome this barriers, you will be stuck in the same place.
