# Smart Cities

## Medical System

* Villages rarely have more than one medical facilities. They have harder access to it.
* Fragile healthcare systems in the rural area due to financial hardship and lack of resources
* This can be solved through telemedicine. Having a decentralised network for the healthcare system where physical presence is not necessary

## Business & Jobs

* Smart cities have more options of business
* Bringing new ideas to market is easier in cities than in villages because you already have infrastructure implemented
* There is an unstoppable need for jobs which require man power

# Smart Villages

## Education

* Do we need to study at a great university to be successful? Maybe we don't even need classes, we just need somewhere to study! Instead of classes, **online open courses** are an alternative.
* Villages can have learning centers instead of big universities

## Transportation

* Villages won't have traffic to an extent that villages have
* We can now buy everything online and receive it fast at home or to an Amazon locker
* The consequences of heavy transportation is air pollution, which doesn't happen in villages

## Healthcare

* Waiting times in big cities is incredibly high
* A decentralised network for the healthcare
* A doctor will
*  be in each village
* The use of big data, wearables, 5G. By using the healthcare data from everyone of the world, you will be able to create the greatest healthcare system. 
* Remote surgery machines that allow for surgeons to operate everywhere in the world
