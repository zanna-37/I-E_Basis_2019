# Exam Q&A for I&E Basics

- 1st call: 13-15 January (doodle to be sent on the 4th of January with the time slots)
- 2nd call: 3-5 February

* **More details on the oral case study?** Format is a presentation of 10 min with 5min for a question round. There's no specific template for the slides and how the presentation should go. Make a high analysis on some topics we covered and regarding innovation and entrepreneurship.

* **Can we choose the same topic of the battle?** We encourage to pick another one unless you have something to add to your previous battle.
* **Do we discuss about something else, like the report in the oral exam?** No, the oral exam is only focused on your presentation. We may expect you to connect with some topics mentioned in class.
* **Should we quote the used references?** Yes, you should add a slide with all the references at the end of the slides.

* **What makes an oral case study good?** Needs to be plausible. If you show to us that what you are proposing is realistic and grounded in current frames, the case study is good. If you focus on one paper, this isn't good. Also the presentation needs to be dynamic and include critical thinking.
* **What does it mean that the case study needs to be plausible?** It means that you are answering the questions proposed and creating a context around the development of your idea.
* **Can we also do the exam on July?** Yes, each part of the exam can be taken in every regular exam call.
* **Agatino asked a question I didn't follow**
* **When is the deadline for the report?** 12th of January at 23h59 CET
* **If we deliver the report on February, can we do the oral presentation in January?** Yes, each part of the evaluation is individual and can be taken separately.
* **I lost another question** something about the questions in the case study
* **Do we have time to think after the questions are made?** Yes, the question answer is 5min. We will ask at most 1 question per person in the jury.
* **The battle report everyone has the same mark?** Yes.
* **When will we have the battle performance marks?** Around the dates of the exams.
* **When will we have all the presentation case studies?** Hopefully by the end of this week.
* **Do we have to send the presentation before the oral exam?** You need to send the PDF one day before the exam.
* **Lost a question**
* **Can we use part of our battle report to expand it and build our presentation?** Of course. If it is not pre-approved topic, send us an email to be approved.
* **If we propose our one topic, should it be like privacy vs transparency?** No, it can be anything.
* **How is the evaluation of the roles?** It is as the battle performance from 1 to 3, it will be discussed internally.
* If you don't have the exam on your career, we can add you manually. If you are from the past year and want to record it, it's also fine.
* **How do we choose which exam call to show up to?**  It's up to you. If you only want to take the exam in June, you can take the exam in June and it's done, you don't need to only select one.
