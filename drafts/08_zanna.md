# Ethics

**Branch of philosophy** that guide us to decide what is **right or wrong**
**Changes** over time `Example:` _Voting right for women_
There is a **collective** (social) dimension
Helps us express **value judgements**

## Why do we need to consider ethics in a business prospective?

Coustomers may judge a company based on their own ethics

## ICT ethics

Cybercrimes are about stealing rights and information. We shift from ethics on goods and action to **ethics with regard to information**.
Not every people have access to infomation
Hard to quantify and qualify information

## Ethical problems

Personal information saved and used by companies
Copyright
Internet access should be a human right
Governament censorship

# What makes an innovation "good"?

# Is technology neutral?

Is the technology biased or is it humans who put bias?
technology unemployment

Technology has a design intent embeded in it, but the user can misunderstand or change the expected behaviour

# Are there emotional machines?

**Emotion:**
- experiencing irrational behaviour
- experiencing uncounscious and uncontrolled reaction to stimuli

Discussion:
- If I can make a synthethic brain functionally equal to a biological brain, then machines can experience emotions
- Since the machines cannot have something uncontrolled they cannot experince emotion
- The programmer can add uncententy to machines

# Biases

## From Kant to ISO

There is a pipeline
philosophy → politics → policy → standard → product design

This pipeline require time for an idea to flow through

# Trust the machine - do we have a choice?

Machines are too complicate to be fully understand, so we are trusting the machine
If we don't trust the machine then humans may be a bottleneck that slows the evolution

## How deep can we dig in a blackbox, before giving up?

Every system is a recursive set of blackbox one inside the other, and as the time passes the blackbox will begin to increase its depth

# Policymaking

Policy:
- set of (high level) rules
  - _different from an algorithm because the latter is more precise and bounded_

Politics:
- creates a dialog
- formalizing ethical context

# Innovation + Social

After Facebook it is OK _(and it is usually considered safe)_ to share real identity information over internet
Digitalizing action that was physical changes how we interact `Example:` _Ordering food_
Universal basic income
Possibility to share personal thoughts and being heard even if you are not famous
