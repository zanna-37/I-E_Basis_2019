# Organisations

**What are organisations and why do we need organisations?** Humans beings together are stronger. It suggests that there are roles. Rules. Hierarchy. Efficiency. Organisations exist to help with decision making.

**Why do we talk about organisations in an I&E class?** Companies are organisations. If we have to develop an idea, we need an organisation. If you set a certain goal, after you achieve the goal, you need to change the organisation. To use as a reference. Identify what works for you.

### The Matrix Organisation

![](img/matrixstructure.png)

The **bug** in the matrix is that all the **transitions are very hard** (product A to B, sales to finance) to make and there are **double chains of command**.

### Case Studies

- How much can an individual impact the organisation?
- How quickly can the organiser respond to disruptions?
- How does the organisation innovate?
- How can the organisation scale?
- What are the key decisions the organisation makes?
- Where are the decision-making bottlenecks?

#### Ubisoft

Ubisoft has a matrix/divisional structure which is more centralised and typical for corporations. They have managed to innovate through game pitches.

- **How much can an individual impact the organisation?** Little, an individual is assigned to a certain function within a certain project and that's the range of his influence in the company.
- **How quickly can the organiser respond to disruptions?** Surprisingly fast, Ubisoft had a bad game reveal and 2 weeks later had already implemented policies to prevent it from happening again.
- **How does the organisation innovate?** Mostly management.

#### Valve

Valve, on the other hand, has a completely decentralised and flat organisational structure.

* **How much can an individual impact the organisation?** An individual in Valve has a lot of potential impact because they can decide where to contribute and they can start new projects or kill old ones.
* **How quickly can the organiser respond to disruptions?**  Quickly, sometimes the organisation is the responsible for disruption.
* **How does the organisation innovate?** An individual can decide to innovate and brings innovation to the organisation.
* **How can the organisation scale?** Right now, Valve is just scaling horizontally which will become impossible at some point.

#### Supercell

Uses an upside-down organisation in which the units are not individuals but cells (or teams).

* **How much can an individual impact the organisation?** It is limited to the team they belong.
* **How quickly can the organiser respond to disruptions?** Very quickly, they can kill a cell and start a new one.
