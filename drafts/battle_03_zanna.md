# Battle 3 - Trust Machines vs Trust Humans

## Trust Machines

- for humans progress it is necessary to trust machine
- queue are a human thing - humans are slow
- in a medical scenario some surgeries might be too complicate to take, and doctors might decide to avoid them
- online banks has less costs, and can use the money saved in a more clever way
- efficiency
  - 24/7
  - scalable
- decision based on numbers, not emotions
  - equal treatement
  - machines are objective
- machines always know the best solution for the global prospective
- machine can quickly find mistakes and prevent crisis and deflation in a economic system
- making error is part of humans existence
- experience is based on ERRORs and they may be costfull
- machine â†’ learn without the need of trivial mistakes (they are already been made by others and they just learn from them)
- machine doesn't fill the pressure and emotions that decrease performance
- less time for surgeries
- better analysis on diagnosis
- machines will be better and more efficient at driving
- less accidents thanks to coordination and precise calculation
  - no distractions
  - no alcool
- less fuel because of smothness of driving
- punctuality, it is possible to have better planning
- coordination
  - communication between machines to handle complex problems
- humans can handle the shift into this vision because we are already moving toward it
- humans can do research and focus on things that matters as spend more time with the family
- it's true that machines can make mistakes but they do it only once, humans make the same mistake over and over again

## Go Humans!

- trust humans in a world dominated by machines
- machines are better on specific tasks but it's better to trust humans for broader jobs
- in a medical field humans can have a better understanding of the patient
  - they can understand feelings and emotions
  - confort the patient
  - machine can only _fake_ emotion
- machines won't be able to do psychiatry because we need a deep emotional connection with the patient in order to succeed
- empathy
  - empathy is a human thing and it's about understanding the human in front of you
  - empathy is important in medicine, as it can change the result of a treatement
  - delicacy on saying difficult news
    - the patient may react badly
- innovation is a matter of creativity
  - these cannot be made by machines
  - humans can think outside the box
- ethics
  - in case of doubts there are ethics
  - algorithm may be biased `Example:` _by the training sample_
- accountability
  - machines are black-box, you cannot understand the reasoning that led to a problem (humans can explain why they did what they did)
- security and privacy
  - machines are curious about data
- machine can be hacked
- humans can deal with unseen scenario and find answers
  - if the scenario is strange enough the machine cannot create a solution because it has not data to base its decision
- We need to invest in humans, and only use machines as a tool
