# From Close to Open Innovation

**Most innovations fail. Companies that don't innovate die.** These statements are related with how innovations are at the core of innovations continue to survive and exist. *How has the process of innovation has changed in the last 20 years? Why is it extremely relevant nowadays and why it makes or breaks organisations?* 

Organisations need to change, over time they evolve their organisational structure. Some organisational structures include matrix, divisional, hierarchial, etc. Companies need to absorb the environment of change internally in order to reproduce the changes and use them in their work. The R&D may happen outside and it needs to be internalised within the organisation by someone.

With digital transformation the focus on what its being developed has been shifted to the customer, integrating customers in the core processes of the company. A customer-centric process nowadays has led to an increase in buy in R&D.

## Paradigm Shift

> "People only see what they are prepared to see." - Ralph Waldo Emerson

30 to 40 years ago, there was the understanding that all products and innovations would be carried out by bigger organisations. Only the ones doing R&D would be the ones to play a role in this innovation process to come with new products and services. These products would be pushed to the market, they were dictating the speed at which the development and technological advancement was happening.

## Closed Innovation

R&D happens within the firm, the logic is that either you buy the knowledge from somewhere but you internalise it and you develop it internally or you have a team of people only working on innovation - having a dedicated team to innovation.

The innovation is not systematic and follows a very linear model that can be production push or market pull. R&D push means doing research and pushing it to production until it reachs customers.

R&D $\to$ Production $\to$ Sales $\to$ Marketing

On the other hand, we observe something in the market and take it back to R&D for development.

R&D $\leftarrow$ Production $\leftarrow$ Sales $\leftarrow$ Marketing

**Virtuous Cycle** The virtous cycle is the cycle that leads an organisation to a thriving environment. R&D leads to breakthroughs, resulting in new products that increase sales and allow for a continuous investement in R&D.

**Competence Trap** The competence trap happens when technological breakthroughs are carried by others which leads to a decrease in sales and profits, taking a company down. Focusing on one sector, in this case, can be harmful to the health of the company.

The closed innovation model is normally vertical. Few people decide what need to be done, the decisions are transformed into action plans, these actions plans are transformed in operations, market feedback is not relevant, the operational line has nothing to do with the external world.

## Open Innovation

In an open innovation world, the knowledge division of labor becomes distributed, systematics, involves all level of the value chain. This is how the world has been currently sourcing knowledge, knowing it doesn't belong to anyone specific but to a group. With open innovation, opening up and cooperation is mandatory and leads to the creation of alliances, joint ventures, networks, communities, clusters, groups of interest, constellations of organisations, etc.

Instead of having R&D as a closed system, meaning that what comes out of it leads to new products or services, a systematics way of innovating was created and that's how open innovation thrives.
