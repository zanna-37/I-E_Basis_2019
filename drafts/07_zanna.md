# Most innovation fail - Companies that don't innovate die

- How the process of innovation change over the last two decades?
- How is it started?
- Why is it relevant?

# We know innovation is important

`Quote:`_"If the rate of change on the outside exceeds the rate of change on the inside, the end is near" - Jack Welch_

When there is a discrepancy in the rate of change inside and outside an organization, there is a problem.

You need to develop new ideas internally or you need to **internalize** the outside development.
If you cannot do any of them the company start to slow down its development.

**Diversity of thoughts** is a key value to innovate.

## Push / pull
**PUSH** → R&D internally and then push the product into the market
**PULL** → Buying from the market the new R&D

People can only deal with the amount of changes they are prepared to

In the past the progress was usually only brought by big companies because of the costs involved in the researches and prototipization.
Cannot continue in this way → **paradigm shift from closed to open innovation**

# Closed innovation

- It follows a **linear model**
- The innovation happens inside the firm, developing everything internally
  - Teams working in the R&D specifically, they do the reaserch outside all other company sectors
  - When they are done, they talk to the manufacture sector that will talk to sales, and so on.
- Impotant to have a **copyright**, to have incomes in return to the research
    - **Problems for patents:**
      - Different patent for different countries
      - The market is moving **too fast to wait for a patent** → innovation cycle is too fast
- Viruos circle

`Example:` _Intel, HP, Xerox, etc - the first in technology development. That development can only be done by big companies_
`Example:` _Pharmacy - they need about 8-15 years before reaching the market. Cannot work on this if you have not capitals and resources_
`Example:` _Car industry_

## Type of organizational control
Vertical because we have few people to decide and no real feedback from the markets.
_Google changed the rules different way of the peolpe working, 50% of people-time on personal projects - pitch the projects to the owners - better to have a great personal project that having success in the main job._
Trying to diversify the source of innovation

Other examples: hackathons

Facebook acquire competitionrs and other companies → they don't have internal innovation so they buy external value

Apple are one of the fewer that still has internal R&D and _push_ to the market

# Virtuos circle broken
much more knowledge available in the system → university, knowledge economy
