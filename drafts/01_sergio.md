# Introduction to Technology Battles

## What is a battle?

A **battle** is, in a nutshell, a case study. A case study is 

What is a case study/elements of a case study

* Something similar to a business idea
* Level of analysis which is open-ended
* Analysis of competing solutions
* A story to illustrate a concept

Today we are going to study the case of how the concorde came to be and subsequent decommission. What are we going to talk about?

* Key actors, 
* main events.

Case studies are usually seen from **two different angles**: 

* **induction** - we get to a general understanding of a phenomen starting from something very specific. The problem with induction is that if our dataset is not general enough, we are getting to the incorrect generalisation. Even more, there are situations in which we might not have knowledge that the dataset is partial, which will also generate an incorrect conclusion. In other words, sampling from a narrow dataset in which can be narrow in quantity or quality dataset.

A case when induction is not applicable: "A farmer feeds a turkey everyday at 8am in any weather conditions. In a day, the turkey was waiting to be fed but the farmer got there and kill it for thanks giving" Karl Popper.

* **deduction** - having a general law and deducting specific cases. The scientific method is falsificatory, we try to find situation in which a law doesn't apply. Water boiling example, altering pressure. A case that doesn't work is for example the Flat earth case, if we try to cherrypick the data. Deduction might not work if we narrow our perspective to know verify our law instead of trying to falsificate it. QAnon example - search

There's a third element to the battles which is the **british parliament** meaning that someone will be moderating, people stand up when they talk, they're not ashamed to be expressive, people shout if they agree, not too formal, there's a designated place to speak and a designated person to start the discussion. These people are designated leaders, they are bold, present, easy to hear, they can be concise, sarcastic, theatrical. This is what goes into a battle.

## Why use battles to teach I&E?

Why use battles to talk about innovation:

* Fun
* Open-mindeness
* Critical thinking
* that's what we need in order to push an innovation forward in real life

These things represent the essence of what innovation is.

Why is this about entrepreneurship:

* Boldness, speaking as representatives
* They are prepared to answer questions that are not previous stipulated, they have to make sense of the situation.
* Competitiveness - you have to persuade other people to agree with your idea, you need consensus.

**Open debate** - discussion about ideas that are still for discussion and have debating ideas with competing possible solutions

**Closed debates** - discussions about ideas that have been established

**Star Wars: Constructing a prequel**

1st exercise: explain the IV, V, VI and I episodes of star wars and then let the person who doesn't know anything about Star Wars to guess what happens in the second and third episodes

2st exercise: explain the I, II, III and IV episodes of star wars and let the person who doesn't know anything about Star Wars to guess the V, VI episodes

### Retrospective vs Prospective reasoning

#### Retrospective case studies

Given the current state of the world, how did we get here?

State of the world $$\to$$ Analysis $$\to$$ Explanation 

**Goal**: retrospectively find answers

#### Prospective case studies

Given an alternate beginning, how could it end?

Alternative beginning $$\to$$ Controversy $$\to$$ Reconciliation 

**Goal**: create questions, affect final result

### Conflict and Competition

In battles in want to have competition - battle - and cooperation - battle report.

In innovation we have a lot of competitors - a lot of things coming out. In entrepreneurship, a company that is just starting needs to compete and beat companies that are much bigger than them. **Disruptive innovation** - we need to face a market that is very big.  Revolut, N26, Iliad , we can find ways to find knowledge to implement in different markets. **Incremental innovation** - we start to get a niche of the market and once the innovation is taken over we try to deploy your new product in other product niche. Example Restaurant vs Ice Cream shop - limited space for advertising. Facebook was seen as incremental - better way of doing social networks but they ended up being disruptive because they changed the market.

### Who wins the battle?

The more persuasive, the more convincing wins the battle.

### Horizontal vs Vertical Content - transversal to all battles vs particular to each one

### Top-Down vs Bottom-Up 

### Example of battle themes

### Class Flow

#### Pre-class

Two weeks before each battle we'll have a meeting in which we will discuss what is allowed and not allowed to be discussed in the battle. We have two weeks to prepare the arguments and research the topic. 

#### In-Class

The two teams will have an opening statement of 15 min each. We open the class for debate, people will be able to stand up, ask a question and the teams will answer to the best of their ability and the other team can interject the answer. At the end for the class, the two teams will go out of the class and each of the teams will try to provide their conclusions in which they will restate their point and state why they are still right. external juris may be invited.

#### Post-Class

In January the two teams need to deliver the battle report. Most points are here.

Summary

- Battles are case studies based on debates
- Debates can be retrospective or prospective
- Focus is on plausibility over fats-of-the-matter
- Content is both horizontal and vertical
- Wrapping and abstraction is done through **scenarios** (titan example)
