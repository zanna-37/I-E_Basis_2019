# Trust the machine vs Trust the man

## Trust the machine

* Infinite queues and lazy employees - delays in day-to-day life, humans fail and have consequences to others
* Humans are fallible and they can say no if they don't feel comfortable - machines won't say no to perform surgery
* Machines are fast, precise and reliable
* Online banks - no queues, 24/7 availability, decisions based on numbers - not on emotions, better management of money, no greed
* if machines run the market, they can quickly if something is wrong and can prevent crisis
* Doctors make mistakes, even when experienced - machines don't have the mental and physical limits of humans and are extremely precise, accurate, take less time and can provide predictions
* Mobility - coordination system can be developed with automated driving systems, removing humans from driving, public transportation
* More time to focus on what matters
* Humans can focus on research and innovating

## Trust the man

* Machines are good at specific tasks but we still need to trust humans
* "The art of medicine is understanding the human in front of you"
* Machines don't have real emotions and thus are impersonal in dealing with humans
* Chat bots are impersonal
* Empathy - psicology treatments need to be personal, delivering bad news
* Innovation - doing research to improve our life, cures for diseases
* Ethics - hypocratical oath, machines are biased
* Accountability - machines are blackboxs, what happens when an error occurs? Who responds for that?
* Security & Privacy - machines learn from data, confidentiality will be broken, machines can be hacked
* Human is the real player in the world
