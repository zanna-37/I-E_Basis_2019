# Battle 4 - Smart Cities vs Smart Countrysides

Two planets have been colonized, in two different ways.
One is decentralized and the other is centralized.

## Smart Countrysides - because decentralized is better

- City comfort and services
- In cities characteristic things lost
- innovation â†’ not a copy of Earth
- Both approaches have opportunities
- Transportation
  - air transportation
  - drones for goods
- Every farmer can sell directly and it is responsible for the quality
- virtualize meeting for work and education
- Robotech: a personal digital assistant
- There are more nature and more space for animals and backyards
- Understimulation is not a problem, as the people vision will change
- You don't have to plan nature, it's already there

## Smart Cities

- Air pollution and overcrowdedness and many others are problems
- The ground area has always remained the same since 1 o 2 hundred years ago
- Global smart city
- Centralized approach
- Transportation
  - Physical activity on the ground level
  - Underground public transportation
  - no cars
    - no jams
    - no parking spot
- Culture
  - Every kind of institution is available
  - workshops and cultural events
- Food
  - different food culture
- many people around, multicultural
- meeting is easier
- central hospitals, best doctors and researches
- Food on demand, shipped in minutes to your home through pipes
- centralized workplace
- In a city, there is positive natural contamination of culture and ideas
- The problem of too much stimulation, fast-moving and stress is something related to modern cities but not related to these new smart cities. They will address this through city plan and activities
- Countrysides are usually associated with relaxing and chilling, so countrysides will face understimulation
- Logistics can become an overhead in countrysides
- Available, reliable TODO see video
