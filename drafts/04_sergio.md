# Digital Transformation

**Digital transformation** is a buzzword and, more than it, a phenomenon that is making quite a change in society. Digital transformation is:

* Transferring what we have in physical resources into a digital format
* Transferring the domain where things are happening into a digital space
* Changing the way we interact - virtually
* Time saving
* An improvement from what we've had

It was initially a buzzword but it is now part of our **reality**. Also, something that we need to take into account is the future impact of it.

## **Digitalization $\to$ Digital Transformation $\to$ Change Management**

* **Digitalization** - the process through which digital technologies are permeating human activities
  * We have had the physical reality, where we exist and now there is another reality which is in development. It has its own rules, structure and mechanisms.
* **Digital Transformation** - the impact of globalisation and digitalisation on organisations and societies; the concrete expressions and actions that businesses need to take as a result of digitalisation (business models, organisational structure, new activities, etc)
  * Disruption of the barriers of reality, we have the world in one place and we can break these barriers through the digital reality.
* **Change Management** - disruption brought forward by digitalisation requires a systematic approach on how to cope with the change and the associated impact that it creates.
  * People are not naturally keen to change, change everyday brings discomfort and tiredness. This field of change management focus on change can be brought to organisations and societies. Basically, how can we minimise the bad impact of this change? For an organisation to adapt to digital transformation it requires a complete re-training of the staff and re-learning on how to deal with customers.

### Digital transformation from a business process point of view

#### The case of a tech company

**Hewlett-Packard** products can be categorised as **hardware** - computers and other devices (printers, scanners, servers, ...) - and **services**.

Hewlett and Packard started a startup in their garage through research. They developed a business of PCs, computers, accessories, etc. HP is also known for the printers and using its supplies for profit (ink cartridges) which allowed them to have a great market share on the printing sector. HP grew so much that it lost its agility and quickiness of response. Around 6 years ago they broke the company in 2 - one focused in the hardware business and another HP Enterprise focused in services.

#### The case of an agriculture/pharmaceutical company

Monsanto is the biggest fertiliser company in the world. They were one of the first companies to capitalize on data analytics by having such precise data, they can offer more profitable solutions for themselves. They are a company focused on their own profit and gains. Digital transformation enabled them to have better business opportunities, even though controversial.

#### The case of a new "breed" company

23andme is DNA company in which people can use a DNA kit to know more about their ethnic background and diseases markers. This is a non-tech company creating a fully digital business. Because of digital transformation this company is having an impact, through digital, in all types of sector such as the police and investigation areas.
