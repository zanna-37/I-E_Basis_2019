## What is the case study does not go well?

Retry! If the mark is still good but not perfect we kindly ask you to not retry it forever until you get a perfect mark, just for the sake of time. If you _really_ need a perfect mark then it is ok to retry even if the mark is not that bad.

## Presentation slides

Send the slide in pdf and you will find them on a computer the day of the exam. If you use other format is ok, sumbit the instruction to make it work but provide a pdf in case something goes wrong.
