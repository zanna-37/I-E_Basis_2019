# Uncertenty
`Ex:` _Weather, quantum states, …_

# Alan Turing
## Contributions
- The Turing machine
  - State machine, infinite memory, process data from the memory
- Turin test
  - Determine the level of AI (Artificial Intelligence)
  - If a human is uncertain about whether the user one is talking to is another human or an AI, then the AI is intelligent
  - Definition of AI
- Decoded the enigma machine

# Decision making in
## Certainty
1. Given **Preferences**
2. We formulate **Goals**
3. Goals lead to **Actions**
4. Actions have concequences **Consequences** with some probability

## Uncertainty
1. Given **Preferences**
2. We formulate **Aspiration levels**
3. That will inform **Information gathering**
4. Apon which we plan **Actions**
5. That have **Uncertain consequences**
6. That might prompt to redefine **Aspiration levels** (`→ 2.`)

`Ex:` _loops, back-propagation, try-catch_
The loops are not for free, they need: power, energy, time. At some time you need to stop.

## Sensemaking

# How can you innovate in uncertenty
Parallelize
Run as many as possible
Prototype to fail cheaper

Looping is not always the way.
`Ex:` _If you continue to loop to improve the candle, you will never discover light bulb_

# Beyond bounded rationality
Overriding the auto-pilot

auto-pilot is riskless and stable but it will always search for the local optimum but not the global optimum

When to override `Ex:` _Emergency situation, training (push yourself forward), oppurtunity that not lies in a usual scenario_

# The unreal
Overruling "manual pilot"

Autopilot blocks you to do an action that will improve your situation

# Competing pilots buying an appliance
If you add parameters the complexity grows exponentially and you may decide to fallback to an autopilot choice `Ex:` _A brand that you used in the past, just the price, one random_

# Dating
TODO manual automatic

# The trouble with digital transformation
You apply a bounded rationality with sometihing that is intrinseclt uncertenty.
