# Overview [ðŸ“¹0:00](https://youtu.be/CaiuLaOAgQs)

# Full Transparency [ðŸ“¹5:54](https://youtu.be/CaiuLaOAgQs?t=354)

The solution for the **transparency** group is having a central database that is accessible by everyone and that contains all the information of everyone. Their main arguments are:

* No more hidden terms and conditions.
* We are entitled to know what is happening in the world.
* Confidential information in HR recruitment - you need to know what went wrong so that you can improve.
* Evidence can be tampered - this is not good. In a transparent world we can know the evidence right away or know that it was tampered.
* Foreign relations - being transparent will kill secrets, if the parties know everything about each other then there's no reason for suspicion.
* We would know that politicians were corrupt, that someone threw the trash in the street, etc.
* Economics - reality in food/shopping

# Full Privacy [ðŸ“¹17:37](https://youtu.be/CaiuLaOAgQs?t=1057)

The solution for the **privacy** group consisted in a chip, in the palm of your hand, that could control your virtual presence, things like obfuscating yourself from private cameras and controlling your online presence and records are possible. Their main arguments are:

* Would you be willing to give your phone to the person behind you?
* The right to privacy is a human right.
* Maybe you're just too weird and have stuff to hide - and that's ok! No one should know about it.
* We all do mistakes behind and regret them, that doesn't mean we need to be prosecuted for them.
* Protecting the judgment of others
* Organ donation needs to be private
* It is a problem if your medical history and records are disclosed
